# Portfolio
This repository is a collection of projects I have completed aimed to showcase both my coding skills and relevant experience. 

## Background 
My name is Tim Murphy. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in December 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics, along with a Certificate in Economic Analytics. I am currently searching for a statistical analyst or data scientist role. I have included projects in this repository to exhibit projects I have completed in the following areas of interest: Sports Analytics, Financial Statistics and Economic Anylatics.
